    <h1>Constitution</h1>
    <h2>Congress</h2>
    <p>The Senate is a group of each head of state which is voted for by the state's populace. The senate votes on issues in congress and is responsible for passing bills. Each state gets one senator, and the president (if not a senator) may cast a vote to break a tie in the senate.</p>
    <p>Senators are elected every 4 months. </p>
    <p>Bills become laws when at least 75% of all senators agree to pass the bill into law. Congress is in control of the treasury and can only provide funds for a project if 66% or above of senators agree.</p>
    <p>Congress is the only body allowed to pass taxes. Congress cannot punish someone for a crime that had not been written into law at the time.</p>

    <h2>President</h2>
    <p>The president is voted for every 6 months by every citizen in Maryland. The person with the most votes wins the elections and becomes president. </p>
    <p>The president can make treaties with other nations but at least 66% of the senate must agree. The president appoints the treasuerer and federal judges.</p>

    <h2>Judiciary</h2>
    <p>The Federal Court is the highest court in Maryland.</p>
    <p>Judges serve for as long as the current president is in office.</p>

    <h2>Constitutional Changes</h2>
    <p>To change the constitution in anyway, at least 80% of all senators must vote in favor.</p>

    <h2>Constitutional Base</h2>
    <p>The constitution is above all and applies to everybody. Laws that go against the constitution are invalid and may be destroyed in the Federal Court.</p>
